Speer Sr.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the LDS Church believes that these are the “last days” of\r\nthe world is beyond dispute. Even naming our Church after the\r\nLatter-days. This doctrine that has been repeated over and over again,\r\nby every prophet and leader, through out the history of the LDS Church.\r\nEvery member understands this doctrine and has been taught since\r\nchildhood to believe it.\r\n\r\nWe’ve been taught; *“For the prophecy came not in old time by the will\r\nof man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy\r\nGhost.”* [(2 Pet.\r\n1:19–21)](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-pet/1.19-21?lang=eng#18)\r\nBut what prophecies have been hidden from the members of the LDS Church?\r\n***“There are those of the rising generation who shall not taste death\r\ntill Christ comes.”*** (Joseph Smith Jr., April 6, 1843 General\r\nConference)\r\n\r\n*“Brethren, these are some of the writings with which you should concern\r\nyourselves, rather than commentaries that may come from those whose\r\ninformation may not be the most reliable and whose motives may be\r\nsubject to question. And may I say, parenthetically, most of such\r\nwriters are not handicapped by having any authentic information on their\r\nwritings”* (Harold B. Lee, in Conference Report, Oct. 1972, 128; or\r\nEnsign, Jan. 1973, 106).\r\n\r\nThe LDS Church since 1820 has had much to say, about the Last Days and\r\nthe 2nd Coming of Jesus Christ, usually focusing not only on the\r\npreparation of his advent, but rather on the signs. This focus often has\r\nthe effect of producing the emotions of fear, doom, and dread – all of\r\nthem incompatible with love. Jesus taught “There is no fear in love; but\r\nperfect love casteth out fear” (1 John 4:18) It’s ironic but not\r\nsurprising that the LDS Church requires more of their members to enter\r\nthe Kingdom of God then Jesus. “v.28 Come unto me, all ye that labour\r\nand are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. v.29 Take my yoke upon\r\nyou, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall\r\nfind rest unto your souls. v.30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is\r\nlight. (Matt 11:28-30)\r\n\r\nHere is a chronological history by the early LDS Church, on the Second\r\nAdvent of Jesus Christ, and predictions of his coming in the following\r\nyears: 1846, before 1880, 1881, 1882 after 1884, 1890-91.\r\n\r\n1820 The Orson Pratt Journals (August 3rd, 1838) “*Mr. Joseph Smith,\r\nJr., who made the following important discovery… was born… on the 23rd\r\nof December, A. D. 1805… When somewhere about fourteen or fifteen years\r\nold [1820], he **began seriously to reflect upon the necessity of being\r\nprepared for a future state of existence;** but how, or in what way, to\r\nprepare himself was a question as yet undetermined in his own mind. He\r\nperceived that it was **a question of infinite importance, and that the\r\nsalvation of his soul depended upon a correct understanding of the\r\nsame.** He saw that if he understood not the way, it would be impossible\r\nto walk in it except by chance, and the thought of resting his hopes of\r\neternal life upon chance or uncertainties was more than he could endure…\r\n[account of the 1st Vision:] he was enrapt in a heavenly vision, and saw\r\ntwo glorious personages who exactly resembled each other in their\r\nfeatures or likeness. He was informed that his sins were forgiven…\r\n[note: not God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ; but two unidentified\r\npersonages] And it pleased God on the evening of the **21st of\r\nSeptember, A. D. 1823**, to again hear his prayers. For he had retired\r\nto rest as usual, only that his mind was drawn out in fervent prayer,\r\nand his soul was filled with the most earnest desire \"to commune with\r\nsome kind messenger who could communicate to him the desired information\r\nof his acceptance with God,\" and also **unfold the principles of the\r\ndoctrine of Christ, according to the promise which he had received in\r\nthe former vision**…* [note: vision not visitation] *This glorious being\r\ndeclared himself to be angel of God,* [note: not God the Father and his\r\nSon Jesus Christ] *sent forth by commandment, to communicate to him that\r\nhis sins were forgiven and that his prayers were heard; and also, to\r\nbring the joyful tidings, **that the covenant which God made with\r\nancient Israel concerning their posterity was at hand to be fulfilled;\r\nthat the great preparatory work for the second coming of the Messiah was\r\nspeedily to commence**; that the time was at hand for the gospel in its\r\nfullness to be preached in power unto all nations; that a people might\r\nbe prepared with faith and righteousness, for the millennial reign of\r\nuniversal peace and joy.”* (Far West, August 3rd, 1838.

Cowdery] I find many who are\r\nwilling to acknowledge that God is pouring out judgment upon the earth,\r\nin our day; but few will admit that he has revealed it to man. This I\r\nconclude, is because they deny the possibility of prophets in these last\r\ndays; for Amos said (3:7) that, \"Surely the lord God will do nothing,\r\nbut he revealeth his secret to his servants the prophets.\" So, admitting\r\nthat ***the cholera is a judgment sent by the Lord to chasten or rebuke\r\nthe world***, which thousands do, they must admit one of two things:\r\nEither God has prophets in these last days unto whom he reveals \"his\r\nsecrets,\" or Amos was no true prophet; but spake lies in the name of the\r\nLord. Because, if this sickness is a judgment, it certainly was once a\r\nsecret, to men, not yet unfolded for either their instruction or\r\ncorrection…\r\n\r\nWe are aware that there are various complaints and diseases common to\r\nvarious countries and climates, these, though never considered by the\r\nworld at large to be special judgments, sent by the hand of the Lord, it\r\nmay strictly be said are his rod to humble men…\r\n\r\nGo to the other places of which I have mentioned, and you find this to\r\nbe the case. Visit the far south, and the yellow fever, with other\r\ndisorders, come periodically, and take from the earth their thousands;\r\nbut no agues, nor consumptions. Such has been the course pursued by a\r\nMaker with his creatures, during our day, and for generations gone-by;\r\nbut no mention of the cholera. Why not? men were the same, formed of the\r\nsame materials, and residing in the same climates.\r\n\r\nIt is said, that this disease first made its appearance at Jessore,\r\nabout 100 miles south of Calcutta, (India,) in August, 1817. To mark its\r\nrapid progress, as it laid desolate villages and cities, would cause\r\none's bosom to be pained for the afflictions of men! We can scarce form\r\nan estimate of its ravages in that remote country for 12 or 13 years.\r\nTowns were depopulated, and countries laid waste as the angel of death\r\nmarched forth to execute his commission! till it spread from the gulf of\r\nTartary to the Mediterranean sea! A once favored land, where light and\r\nknowledge beamed from the regions of glory to illuminate the path of\r\nmen, though long since sunk in darkness, once more felt the chastening\r\nhand of God.\r\n\r\nIn 1830 the Destroyer began to execute his work in Europe, and the\r\nfirst, it is said, who were doomed to suffer by him, were the\r\ninhabitants resident at the mouth of the Volga on the Caspian sea. Soon,\r\nyou know, desolation marked his course over Europe, and by his hand\r\nmany, very many, were removed from time. In May, or June, 1832 he set\r\nfoot upon our shores.-The people of Quebec felt the scourge, and soon a\r\ngreat part of the continent were groaning under the affliction. I have\r\nmarked its progress these two years with some minuteness. In 1832 it\r\nspread from the North to the South; in 1833 it carried thousands to\r\ntheir long homes in the South and West, far West, and in 1834 it comes,\r\nlike a \"strong man armed!\" and extends in rapid strides from South to\r\nNorth! What can stay this mighty Destroyer in his course? can the skill\r\nof men who have, for their whole life, studied the secrets of disease to\r\nrender usefulness to their fellow-men? No! the wisdom of the wise falls\r\nuseless, while the ocean, the fortress, \"the high tower,\" the lofty\r\nmountains, streaked with pearling streams, with mighty rivers rolling to\r\nseek their equilibrium, are also rendered no place of security!-he flies\r\no'er oceans, he walks o'er countries, he spreads terror and dismay in\r\nall ranks and conditions of men, and scatters the \"seeds of death\" in\r\nall climates, to execute his great commission, till, in fact, it is, as\r\nthe prophet said should be, a vexation only to hear the report!\r\n\r\nI have, myself, passed through towns, cities, and villages, as well as\r\nsections of our country, where hundreds were, by him, snatched from time\r\nto eternity, in an hour. I have seen the effects of his desolating march\r\nand witnessed the pale countenances of men who were just touched with\r\nhis finger, and left as monuments of his power, with fallen cheeks and\r\nsunken eyes! I have seen the bereaved husband, the fatherless child, and\r\nthe disconsolate widow, and others whose faces wore a settled gloom, and\r\nwhen met in the streets, would start as from a revery of death, or a\r\nconverse with departed friends! Nor do I presume that my eyes have\r\nwitnessed a beginning of what others have experienced. But I will assure\r\nyou, that a thinking man's mind will be occupied with no ordinary\r\nreflections, to walk in the house of death, and to be surrounded by a\r\npower sent from God to chasten the world! In truth, it will awaken every\r\nfaculty of the soul, and call forth the strictest scrutiny of one's\r\nreligion, to know whether he is prepared to meet the judgment, if he has\r\nnot faith to stand. Amid this mighty contagion, or, not properly\r\ncontagion, but desolation, one will stand with feelings of reverence\r\nwhen he knows that it is a scourge of the Almighty; and as he reflects\r\nupon the system on which his hope is based, he will stand with fearless\r\ncontemplation, and say, This is no less than the power of God to prepare\r\nthe way for his advent in glory!\r\n\r\nThe first season after the Destroyer visited our land, you will\r\nrecollect to have seen almost all denominations of people professing the\r\nreligion of heaven, assembling for prayer and fasting to turn away the\r\nscourge. The several Governors in whose respective States the afflicting\r\nangel came, were very careful to make mention of the same in their\r\nmessages to the Legislatures; and what is still more interesting here to\r\nbe observed is, that they acknowledged that it was a judgment, a special\r\njudgment…\r\n\r\n<span id=\"190\" class=\"anchor\"></span>...I am informed by some of your\r\nprevious communications, that the church in your place and vicinity\r\nnumbered over sixty. This is pleasing intelligence to us: we are not, as\r\nPaul said some would be in the last days, \"unthankful;\" but on every\r\nremembrance of his mercy, (and we desire not to be unmindful,) we give\r\nthanks. Yours truly. OLIVER COWDERY. (To W. A. COWDERY, THE EVENING AND\r\nTHE MORNING STAR, Vol. II, Liberty, Mo., Aug. 24, 1834, No. 24,\r\n<http://www.centerplace.org/history/ems/v2n24.htm>)\r\n\r\n1834 September, ADDRESS TO THE PATRONS OF THE EVENING AND THE MORNING\r\nSTAR. While looking at this church as it was four years since, or a few\r\nmonths previous to that time, the mind starts with astonishment, and the\r\nreflection arises in an instant, **What will be its end?** If, in the\r\nshort space of four years its numbers have increased to thousands; if,\r\nin the midst of unparalleled persecution and opposition (considering the\r\nform of government under which it exists) it has spread from one side of\r\nthe continent to the other; if, where bigotry has walked undisturbed,\r\nand superstition held an unmolested sway; if, in an age when iniquity\r\nabounds, and the love of men waxes cold, it has pursued its steady\r\ncourse, and found way to the hearts of multitudes, what will be its\r\nstanding when half a century shall have passed away? If, amid every\r\nslander imaginable, and every calumny possible, it has gained its\r\nhundreds and thousands, what will be its influence, and what its numbers\r\nwhen the world shall know the purity of its doctrines, the perfection of\r\nits principles, and the honesty of its followers? If, amid false\r\nrepresentations, and wicked insinuations of men of corrupt hearts,\r\naccusing this innocent body of usurpation, disloyalty, and treason, it\r\nhas still progressed, and among the honest, found advocates, what will\r\nbe the sound of the flocking to its communion of men of all nations,\r\nwhen a little time shall pass over, and the beauty and excellence of its\r\nreligion shine in the face of all people, and the framers of these\r\nreports be exposed to the just reproach of an abused public, and the\r\nhail shall have swept away the refuge of lies?\r\n\r\nIn the commencement of this church, and we perfectly recollect the\r\nassertions, it was prophesied that one year would terminate its\r\nexistence! One year, and all would see the \"delusion,\" and be convinced\r\nof the \"deception!\" But one, yes, **four have passed, and yet it\r\nstands!** When persecution raged in one place; when the regions of\r\ndarkness emitted its whole band of infernals, and when wrath poured from\r\nthe lips of men upon the heads of the Saints that they could not endure,\r\nthey have fled where they could be protected, while the influence of\r\ntruth was still operating upon hundreds elsewhere; the servants of the\r\nLord heard with attention; God manifesting himself in mercy, and the\r\nHoly Spirit bearing record of HIS \"marvelous work,\" the church of Christ\r\nhas received into its bosom the pure in heart, and angels have borne the\r\njoyful tidings to the regions of glory!\r\n\r\nMany have strove to prevent the true knowledge of the principles of our\r\nreligion from being introduced into the ranks of men to be investigated\r\nwith candor, by slandering the characters of those who were advocating\r\nthem, endeavoring thereby to rivet the fetters of superstition and\r\nignorance upon their followers with a firmness which defies all power to\r\nunlock them, thus preparing them to be consumed when the great day of\r\nburning comes, because their own systems could not stand the strict\r\nscrutiny of truth contained in those sacred records which teach men to\r\nforsake the corruptions of the world, for the wiser course and richer\r\nreward promised therein! But if such have not become convinced of their\r\nweakness yet, after pursuing in a path which brings no joy, a season\r\nlonger, perhaps they may abandon it. Whether they do or do not the\r\npurposes of God will be accomplished. While one man has cried\r\n\"delusion,\" another \"false prophets,\" and a third has reported a long\r\ncatalogue of falsehoods of his own making, to blast the characters of\r\nmen whom he never saw nor had a spark of evidence against, the fourth\r\nhas seen the iniquity of the whole, and the first opportunity, with a\r\nthankful heart, embraced the gospel and rejoiced in the assurance\r\nmanifested by the Spirit of the Lord?\r\n\r\nOn occasions like the present the mind naturally goes **back to the\r\nstarting point**, or period when the world first heard the sound of the\r\nfulness [fullness] of the everlasting gospel in these days; when a few\r\nonly were to be found on earth who had stepped forward into the new\r\ncovenant, and proved by an experimental knowledge the word of an apostle\r\nto be true, \"He that lives godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer\r\npersecution.\" However various may be the opinions of men, no one thing\r\nis more certain than this: In a corrupt generation, when the Lord spake\r\nto man, those hearing and obeying that voice, always have suffered\r\nreproach and abuse. It may be said that false systems as well as true\r\nones have suffered their share of persecution, and that this is not a\r\ncorrect way to judge what is right and what is not. The Savior was\r\npersecuted, the apostles were persecuted, the church in the days of Nero\r\nand his successors, for a season, was persecuted, the Waldenses and\r\nothers were persecuted, the Baptists and Quakers in New England were\r\npersecuted, the followers of Anna Lee, Jemima Wilkinson, and others were\r\nalso persecuted, and were we to say that all who have been persecuted\r\nfor their religion's sake were equally correct, would be to rank them in\r\none general mass and seat them down in the same kingdom, partakers of\r\nthe same joys and blessings: for, if the word of the Lord is true, all\r\nare blessed who are persecuted for his sake. How then shall we determine\r\nwho are correct, since so many have been persecuted? The Savior was\r\ntrue, or we are yet in our sins, our faith is vain, and our bodies\r\ndestined to be prisoners to the grave forever! But did he persecute? did\r\nhis saints after him? if he nor they did not, unless it can now be\r\nproven from his word that the principle is correct, this fact is\r\nestablished, that those who persecute are the children of \"that wicked\r\none.\" From these items, without saying that this one is correct or\r\nincorrect, who have been persecuted for their religion, if ever a fact\r\ndid exist, or a truth sound from heaven in the ears of man, those who\r\nhave persecuted this church to which we have a privilege of being a\r\nmember, reproachfully and slanderously called \"Mormonite,\" are, as has\r\njust been said, of their father the devil, and if they ever had\r\ncommunion or fellowship with the Lord they have forsaken his house, left\r\nhis fold, and like wandering stars, filthy dreamers, or beasts of\r\ncorruption, abandoned to be taken and destroyed in their own wickedness!\r\n\r\n*Since June, 1832, various changes have been noticed by the observing\r\nmind, and particularly by the man who is **looking for the fulfillment\r\nof the words of the ancient prophets [second coming],** as well as the\r\ndeclarations of the Lord Jesus. Abroad he has witnessed one calamity\r\nfollow another, and one desolation march in quick succession in the\r\ntrain of a former, until nations have felt their weight, and kingdoms,\r\ncontries [countries], and wide spread empires, withered at the touch of\r\nthe judgments of the Lord. War, with its horrors and distresses, has\r\nsummoned its thousands to appear before the great tribunal; the same\r\nspirit of ambition and thirst for power has been previlent [prevalent]\r\namong the great; the weak have been destined to relinquish their claims\r\nof authority by combinations of different kingdoms; the yoke of\r\noppression has alternately passed into the hands of different masters;\r\nthe low and oppressed have struggled in vain for freedom, while time, in\r\nits same rapid and mighty course, **has been bringing near and more\r\nnear** the august period when the sun is to become as sackcloth of hair,\r\nthe moon turn to blood, the stars fall from heaven, and the powers of\r\nheaven be shaken!*\r\n\r\n*No man, in his sober senses, with the word of God in his hand, can\r\nreflect one moment upon these scenes without being filled with awe! In\r\ndistant lands, now abandoned to darkness, where human beings bow down\r\nand worship the work of their own hands, and call for assistance upon a\r\nblock of wood of their own carving, have also felt the sting of\r\npestilence, the angel of death, and the calamity of war! Whose heart,\r\nthen, when gazing upon the finger of Omnipotence, as it moves creations\r\nround, and orders all things for the accomplishment of his own purposes,\r\nwill not be touched with reverence as he thus sees the glorious era\r\nhastening on when the redeemed, yes, the ransomed of the Lord shall be\r\nassembled, his elect gathered home, wickedness and corruption destined\r\nto dwell in their own place, while peace and joys everlasting crown the\r\nblessed?*\r\n\r\n*Said the Lord: \"You shall hear of wars and rumors of wars.\" But our\r\nfriends often say, that since Noah the same has been heard, and the end\r\nis not yet. Said the Lord: \"There shall be earthquakes in diverse\r\nplaces.\" But say the world, earthquakes have desolated countries and\r\nkingdoms centuries previous, and the end is not yet. If there is not a\r\nparticular meaning attached to each of these assertions, why were they\r\never spoken? Unless the Savior had his mind upon the future period,\r\nwhich should roll on in its course, and bring these sayings to the\r\nfullest degree of plainness to be understood, why did he speak them? Did\r\nHE not know that the inhabitants of the earth had experienced the\r\ncalamity occasioned by the march of war? Did HE not know that his\r\nfollowers were acquainted with the fact, that others before them had\r\nfelt the hand of justice and judgment in the desolations of earthquakes?\r\nEighteen hundred years have passed since these words **[of the second\r\ncoming],** were spoken; war has succeeded war; blood has flowed after\r\nblood; the cry of the widow and orphan has saluted the skies; man has\r\ninvariably followed the same course, and the world exists, the elements\r\nremain, and the end is not yet! Century has slept after century;\r\nwickedness has borne its accustomed sway; the great deceiver has blinded\r\nand led captive his millions; truth has fled, virtue ceased,\r\nrighteousness failed from off the earth, and the boaster against God has\r\nraised his head in blasphemies, from age to age, and the end is not yet!\r\nTruly spake an ancient apostle, when he said they would say, \"Where is\r\nthe promise of his coming?\" The earth has rolled round; the different\r\nworlds have continued to move in their regular order; the sun is still\r\nbrilliant; the moon shines upon earth, and the end is not yet!*\r\n\r\n*Thus passes the world along-unwilling to acknowledge the hand of God in\r\nhis providences, while pestilence stalks at their doors, and the waster\r\nconsumes at mid-night; the plague devouring its thousands, & the\r\ndestroyer performing his desolating march in the sight of all; the voice\r\nof the Most High heard from his holy habitation, and the angels flying\r\nin the midst of heaven; the earth just on the eve of rocking to and fro\r\nlike the waves of the great ocean, and eternity filled with pain for the\r\ncorruption of man; the holy messengers from above holding the four winds\r\nwhile he that holds the keys seals the servants of God in their\r\nforeheads; the warning voice going forth for all to be READY, and the\r\nlight of truth illuminating the hearts of the poor, lest when HE comes\r\nfaith shall not be found; the signs of his near approach beginning to be\r\nmanifested, by tokens which are not to be misinterpreted, and the hearts\r\nof many ready to receive the admonition-Prepare! the church, the bride,\r\nthe Lamb's wife adorning herself with her beautiful attire, and decking\r\nherself with the wedding garments, making all things ready for the\r\nword-He comes! and anxiously waiting the glorious period when the\r\neverlasting doors, even the gates of the celestial city shall again be\r\nlifted up, that the King of glory may descend to be crowned Lord and\r\nKING OF ALL!*\r\n\r\n*But the scenes abroad are not all which have transpired since 1832 to\r\nawaken the studious mind to reflection. At home he has found a field for\r\nmeditation, calculated to arouse the intellect and call up the words of\r\nthe ancient prophets, to see whether they, in the midst of their\r\nheavenly visitations, touched upon a period when perplexity and strife\r\nshould rack the systems and inventions of the wise, as at this day. We\r\nhave seen this liberal government tossed to and fro by the ambition of\r\nmen; the great principles of union and social compact severed at a\r\ntouch, and war, civil war, with all its horrors, threaten us with\r\ndesolation! \"Rumors of wars\" have surely come upon us! We have seen men\r\nprofessing the religion of heaven rise up against their neighbors \"to\r\nput them to death!\" We have seen a community composing a part of this\r\ngovernment defy law, despise justice, and tread upon the innocent\r\nbecause they were weak! We have witnessed mob after mob rise up in our\r\nmost populous cities, and towns, and trample upon good order with the\r\nreclessness [recklessness] of the savage! Yes, we have seen more! The\r\nDestroyer has set foot upon our shores, and summoned thousands to their\r\n\"long homes!\" His march has been rapid, and his path has proven his\r\ncommission! Amid calamities like these we can only say to all, while\r\nthese scenes are transpiring, and new ones are bursting upon us, **let\r\nus be ready, for HIS coming is near!***\r\n\r\nOLIVER COWDERY.

Oliver Cowdery notes: The following\r\nare patriarchal blessings pronounced upon those named, by president\r\nJoseph Smith sen. on the 27th day of August, 1835. There were many\r\nblessings given previous to these, but the book not being obtained until\r\na few weeks since, it would be difficult to arrange all the blessings as\r\nthey were pronounced: indeed this would be impossible as many retained\r\ntheir blessings in their own hands, not yet having handed them in to be\r\nrecorded. All that I shall observe in recording blessings hereafter is,\r\nto give their several dates. This however will not be possible always,\r\nas the clerks have not been particular to note the day and the month.\r\nOne remark is necessary: It will be seen, that in the commencement of\r\nthis record, I noticed that the first meeting was opened by prayer: this\r\norder is strictly observed in all patriarchal meetings, either by the\r\none pronouncing the blessings or one whom he appoints.

Young] came forward and said— *“The principles taught by the\r\nLatterday Saints are no ordinary principles, but embrace the salvation\r\nof the whole world, and for that reason the servants of God have been\r\nsent through the world to bear testimony to their truth. *\r\n\r\n*We have partaken of the Sacrament, because Jesus had said, \"Do this in\r\nremembrance of me, till I come again,\" and this proved that the work of\r\nthe Redeemer was but partly finished, the grand consummation being\r\nwithheld until a time in the future, when the Lord would again visit the\r\nearth in power and great Glory. Will our Lord thus come again before a\r\npeople are prepared to receive him? No, he will not. Now, where are the\r\npeople on earth who are preparing to receive him? **I know the\r\nLatter-day Saints, as a people, are doing so, and have their eyes fixed\r\non the time of His second coming.** *\r\n\r\n*I testify that we, as a people, are preparing to receive him when he\r\ncomes, and **that no people are so blessed** as they who thus wait on\r\nthe Lord. But, though the Saints thus wait for him, they do not expect\r\nto see him until they are prepared. Suppose the Lord was to come down\r\nbefore this preparation was made, and begin to overturn the tables as he\r\ndid in the Temple in days of old. **This generation, had they the power,\r\nwould kill him as soon as they did Joseph Smith, and for the same\r\nreason.”*** (THE LATTERS-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR, No. 24, Vol.\r\nXXVII, Pub. 17 June 1865, London England, page 368)\r\n\r\n<https://books.google.com/books?id=dS8EAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA369&lpg=PA369&dq=Daniel+H.+Wells+second+coming&source=bl&ots=J-j5nxKl_D&sig=kgIJXhqpjv51NVPnF3tsexV7MoM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=lA-vVKnUNoLpoAS1w4KwDw&ved=0CD8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=second%20coming&f=false>\r\n\r\n1866 The great American Republic is now one of the most powerful\r\ngovernments in the world . . . . But that great–that powerful nation–is\r\ndestined to an utter overthrow. If it be asked, why is America to\r\nsuffer? The answer is, because they have rejected the kingdom of God,\r\nand one of the greatest divine messages ever sent to man; because they\r\nhave sanctioned the killing of the Saints, and the martyrdom of the\r\nLord’s Prophets, and have suffered his people to be driven from their\r\nmidst, and have robbed them of their houses, and homes, and land, and\r\nmillions of property, and have refused to redress their wrongs.\r\n\r\nFor these great evils, they must suffer; the decrees of Jehovah have\r\ngone forth against them; the sword of the Lord has been unsheathed, and\r\nwill fall with pain upon their devoted heads. Their great and\r\nmagnificent cities are to be cut off. New York, Boston, Albany, and\r\nnumerous other cities will be left desolate. Party will be arrayed in\r\ndeadly strife against party; State against State; and the whole nation\r\nwill be broken up; the sanguinary weapons of the dreadful revolution\r\nwill devour the land. Then shall there be a fleeing from one city to\r\nanother, from one State to another, from one part of the continent to\r\nanother, seeking refuge, from the devastations of bandits and armies;\r\nthen shall their dead be left unburied, and the fowls of heaven shall\r\nsummer upon them, and the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Lord will visit them with the deadly pestilence which\r\nshall sweep away many millions by its ravages; for their eyes shall fall\r\nfrom their sockets, and their flesh from their bones, and their tongues\r\nshall be staid in their mouths, that they shall not be able to blaspheme\r\nagainst their Maker. And it will come to pass, that the heavens will\r\nwithhold their rains and their fruitful fields be turned into\r\nbarrenness, and the waters of their rivers will be dried up, and left in\r\nstanding pools, and the fish therein will die; and the Lord will send\r\nforth a grievous plague to destroy the horses and cattle from the land.\r\nThus by the sword and by pestilence, and by famine, and by the strong\r\narm of the Almighty, shall the inhabitants of that wicked nation be\r\ndestroyed. In that day a remnant shall repent, and be numbered with the\r\npeople of Zion, and shall know that the Lord hath spoken, and hath\r\nfulfilled his decrees upon the land, and executed his fierce justice\r\nupon the oppressors of his people.

The inhabitants of Illinois and Missouri were in\r\ndreadful condition, the men and women killing each other in the most\r\nbrutal manner.*\r\n\r\n*Next I visited the City of Washington, D.C., and found the place\r\ndeserted and in ruins. From there I went to Baltimore and on the square,\r\nwhere stands the monument of 1812, dead bodies of the inhabitants of the\r\nplace were piled in heaps. While there I saw mothers cut the throats of\r\ntheir own children and drink the blood in order to quench their thirst.\r\nThe waters of the Chesapeake Bay were so befouled from the effect of\r\ndead bodies that the water could not be used. Sickness and death\r\nprevailed throughout the city and the stench was something awful. I\r\nthought surely that this must be the end of suffering, but when I\r\nvisited the City of Philadelphia, I found the place in ruins and the\r\nsmell from dead bodies was beyond anything one could imagine.*\r\n\r\n*In New York I saw men crawl out of cellars, ravish beautiful women,\r\nkill them and rob them of their jewels. I saw parents eating the flesh\r\nof their own offspring and then roll over and die. Looking back while on\r\nmy way to Central Park, I saw fire break out and a heavy wind carried\r\nthe flames over the city, and all the buildings, wharfs and ships in the\r\nharbor were burned. The stench from the burning bodies was carried by\r\nthe wind across the Hudson River spreading death and destruction\r\nwherever it went. The sights that met my view on all sides were so\r\nhorrible to look upon that it would be impossible for me to describe\r\nthem.*\r\n\r\n*After these scenes had passed, I found myself standing on the left bank\r\nof the Missouri River, just opposite to where stood the City of\r\nIndependence and soon discovered that the states of Illinois, Missouri,\r\nand part of Iowa had been swept clean of its inhabitants and the\r\nsurrounding country was a complete wilderness. *\r\n\r\n*A short distance across the river, I beheld twelve men dressed in their\r\ntemple robes standing in a square with their hands raised, and it was\r\nmade known to me that they represented the twelve gates of the New\r\nJerusalem. They then consecrated the grounds and laid the cornerstones\r\nof the city and temple; and while they were doing so, I saw myriads of\r\nheavenly angels hovering over them. I heard the most beautiful music and\r\nsinging that I ever listened to and these were the words they repeated:\r\n**“Now is established the Kingdom of our God and His Christ which shall\r\nno more be thrown down or given to another people.”***\r\n\r\n***I then saw a multitude of people coming from various directions to\r\ntake part in the upbuilding of the city and temple and even the angels\r\nwere on hand to assist in the glorious work. A great cloud arose above\r\nthem and many of the saints were clothed in their temple robes.** All of\r\na sudden I found myself standing at the pulpit of the Ogden Tabernacle,\r\nyet I could see the building of the city of Zion and temple going on and\r\nthe cloud that hovered above the place.*\r\n\r\n*I had become so animated by this time that I called upon the\r\ncongregation to listen to the sweet music and singing of the angels that\r\nseemed to fill the house. Then **I heard a voice say, “Now has come to\r\npass that which was spoken by the mouth of Isaiah the Prophet**, where\r\nhe declares that \\`Seven women shall take hold of one man saying, We\r\nwill eat our own bread and wear our own apparel, only let us be called\r\nby thy name to take away our reproach.’”*\r\n\r\n*By this time I was so exhausted that I staggered backwards, and Brother\r\nFranklin D. Richards and some of the other brethren caught me before I\r\nfell. I then asked Brother Richards to apologize for me stopping so\r\nabruptly in my remarks, and to tell them that I had not fainted, but was\r\novercome from exhaustion. I then rolled over in bed and the clock in the\r\nCity and County Building struck twelve.”* (Wilford Woodruff’s Journal,\r\nJune 15, 1878, A Vision, Salt Lake City, Night of Dec 16, 1877)\r\n\r\n<http://visionsandtribulation.blogspot.com/search/label/New%20Civil%20War%20US>\r\n\r\n1879, 47 years after the 1832 Missouri Temple Revelation, ([D&C\r\n84:1-5,31,32](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.1-5,31,32?lang=eng#1))\r\nin the [1879 Edition of the Doctrine and\r\nCovenants](http://books.google.com/books?id=sgsDAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA289#v=onepage&q&f=false)\r\nthis footnote was added to [Section\r\n84:5](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.1-5,31,32?lang=eng#1)\r\n**“*A generation does not all pass away in a hundred years.”*** Note:\r\nThe footnote was removed after 1932\r\n\r\n*“It may be reasonable to assume that in giving this revelation to the\r\nProphet, **the LORD did have in mind the generation of people who would\r\nstill be living within the one hundred years from the time of the\r\nannouncement of the [Lords] revelation,** and that they would enjoy the\r\nblessings of the temple, and a glorious cloud would rest upon it.

Cannon spoke of the lofty conceptions of the saints, especially\r\nregarding the future state. He believed the brethren in the penitentiary\r\nwould be more prosperous when they got out than if they had not got in,\r\nbecause they could say they had not broken any of the covenants they had\r\nmade. He thanked God he lived among such people; those who were not\r\nafraid of consequences and took punishment like heroes.\r\n\r\nHe said that the time is coming when this conduct of the Latter-Day\r\nSaints would stand out as the brightest page in modern history, and that\r\ntheir sufferings would be acceptable to the Lord.\r\n\r\n**Cannon further said** he would obey the laws, bow in submission to the\r\nnation and leave the consequences to the Lord. **He told the people not\r\nto worry about 1891; that Christ would not come then.**\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon President Woodruff spoke. He said “*the Lord was about\r\nto **prune his vineyard for the last time**, and that sprouts would fall\r\nlike grain before the mower.”* END [100+1890=1990]\r\n\r\nNOTE: I found this article as I was doing genealogical research on\r\ngt-grandfather John Speer who immigrated in 1882 to San Francisco.

One of the lodgerooms in\r\nPythian Hall was comfortably filled last evening by ladies and gentlemen\r\nanxious to hear Elder Henry S. Tanner of the Church of Christ of Latter\r\nDay Saints speak upon the Second Coming of the Savior. Mr. Tanner\r\nconcerned himself with four interesting elements of his theme, touching\r\nsuccessively upon the matters of why, when, where and how the\r\nextraordinary event may be expected to manifest itself.\r\n\r\nFor reasons indicating and assuring the Second Coming of Christ, Mr.\r\nTanner drew extensively upon the scriptures, and generally explained\r\nthat the Redeemer's mission had been completed only in part, and that\r\nanother visit to earth and intercourse with man were necessary to the\r\naccomplishment of his divine purpose. The life of Christ on earth formed\r\na portion of the discourse, and Mr. Tanner indicated numerous\r\nmanifestations of the Savior's divinity and the methods by which his\r\npurpose was to be attained. The scriptures also afforded Elder Tanner\r\nevidence to the fact that this event will occur in a period of\r\npersecution, extraordinary confusion and distress of nations.\r\n\r\nMr. Tanner believed that the world's present unsettled condition\r\nforebodes more serious disturbances, and at no very distant day the\r\nSecond Coming of Christ. With the manner of its occurrence and where the\r\nevent may happen, Mr. Tanner concluded his discourse.\r\n\r\n(San Francisco Call, Volume 78, Number 24, Monday, 24 June 1895)\r\n<http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=SFC18950624.2.142&srpos=1&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN-mormon%2b%22second+coming%22+------#>\r\ngenealogy\r\n<http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=ldshistorical&id=I44776>\r\n\r\n1898 April *“Jesus will come by and by, and appear in our midst, as He\r\nappeared in the day when upon the earth among the Jews, and He will eat\r\nand drink with us and talk to us, and explain the mysteries of the\r\nKingdom, and tell us things that are not lawful to talk about now.”*\r\n([](https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-of-presidents-of-the-church-lorenzo-snow/chapter-24-reflections-on-the-mission-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng&clang=ase#15-36787_000_24)Conference\r\nReport, Apr. 1898, 13–14.)\r\n\r\n1899 April, *“**The precise time of Christ’s coming has not been made\r\nknown to man**.

Smith instituted a policy of\r\nassimilation rather than separation. Between 1897 and 1907, the Church\r\nreplaced eleven apostles, two members of the First Council of the\r\nSeventy, and four members of the Presiding Bishopric. Thus, out of the\r\ntwentyfive General Authorities, all were men who had no personal\r\nassociation with either Joseph Smith or the profoundly millennial\r\nworldview of his generation.

So our church leaders have\r\n***forced*** a decision on us through their ***deception***; you either\r\nbelieve in Mormonism and receive Eternal Life or you’re an apostate and\r\nwill have Eternal Torment.

It is also reasonable\r\nto believe that no soul living in 1832, is still living in mortality on\r\nthe earth. …Verily, verily, I [God] say unto you, that when I give a\r\ncommandment to any of the sons of men to do work unto my name, and those\r\nsons of men go with all their might and cease not their diligence, and\r\ntheir enemies come upon them and hinder them from performing that work,\r\nbehold it behooveth me to require that work no more at the hands of\r\nthose sons of men, but to accept their offerings.\"* (Joseph F.

In 1807,\r\n[celibacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celibacy) was advocated as the\r\npreferred custom of the community in an attempt to purify themselves for\r\nthe coming [Millennium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennialism).\r\n\r\nRapp believed that the events and wars [war of 1812] going on in the\r\nworld at the time were a confirmation of his views regarding the\r\nimminent [Second Coming of\r\nChrist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Coming). Rapp predicted that\r\non September 15, 1829, the three and one half years of the [Sun\r\nWoman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman_of_the_Apocalypse) would end\r\nand [Christ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ) would begin his reign\r\non earth. After Rapp's death in 1847, a number of members left the group\r\nbecause of disappointment and disillusionment over the fact that his\r\nprophecies regarding the return of Jesus Christ in his lifetime were not\r\nfulfilled.\r\n\r\nThe Harmonites were\r\n[Millennialists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennialism), in that\r\nthey believed [Jesus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus)\r\n[Christ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ) was coming to earth in\r\ntheir lifetime to help usher in a thousand-year kingdom of peace on\r\nearth. This is perhaps why they believed that people should try to make\r\nthemselves \"pure\" and \"perfect\", and share things with others while\r\nwillingly living in\r\n[communal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commune_(intentional_community))\r\n\"harmony\" ([Acts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_the_Apostles)\r\n[4:32-37](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_communism#Early_Christian_Communism))\r\nand practicing [celibacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celibacy). They\r\nbelieved that the old ways of life on earth were coming to an end, and\r\nthat a new perfect kingdom on earth was about to be realized.\r\n\r\nThe Harmonite commune ultimately failed because the policy of celibacy\r\nprevented new members from within, and the majority of the outside world\r\nhad no desire to give up so much to live in a commune. The society was\r\nformally dissolved in 1906.\r\n\r\n<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Rapp>\r\n\r\n**Jehovah Witness:** In our church we kinda talk badly about Jehovah\r\nWitness and some of their beliefs.

Section Five 1842-43, p.253\r\n<http://www.boap.org/LDS/Joseph-Smith/Teachings/T5.html> )\r\n\r\nhttps://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/chapter-21?lang=eng\r\n\r\nPulsipher, Zerah 1789-1872\r\n\r\nAutobiography (c. 1803-1862)\r\n\r\nTypescript, HBLL.\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF ZERA PULSIPHER\r\n\r\nAS WRITTEN BY HIMSELF\r\n\r\nI was about fourteen or fifteen years of age… I have often heard my\r\nfather say that the signs of Christ's second coming was often seen and\r\nthat he would come before many years should pass away. And if they did\r\nnot live to see it, likely his children would.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I was about twenty-one I married a very agreeable\r\ncompanion, lived with her about one year when she died leaving one child\r\nwhich we named Harriett. After the death of my wife (Polly or Mary\r\nRandell) I had some anxiety about her state and condition, consequently\r\nin answer to my desires in a few weeks she came to me in vision and\r\nappearing natural looked pleasant as she ever did and sat by my side and\r\nassisted me in singing a hymn - beginning thus: \"That glorious day is\r\ndrawing nigh when Zions Light Shall Shine.\" This she did with a seeming\r\ncomposure.\r\n\r\nThis vision took away all the anxiety of my mind concerning her in as\r\nmuch as she seemed to enjoy herself well. This hymn which she introduced\r\nand sang with me applied to the great work of the last dispensation of\r\nthe fullness of times. This transpired about ten years before Joseph\r\nSmith had discovered the first revelation of the work of the last days.\r\nMy mind became calm as respecting her condition in the spirit world.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1814 I hired a farm at Bellows falls on the Connecticut\r\nRiver and being alone gave my brother John the privilege to work it with\r\nme. In the fall of that season there were the most extraordinary\r\nnorthern lights that I had ever saw, it was the cause of many\r\nspeculative notions among the people but my father said it was the signs\r\nof the last days and of Christ's second coming. I regarded my father's\r\nremarks as specimens of good sense.\r\n\r\nJoseph Smith was the founder of the Mormon Church. He saw in a vision\r\nthat the Kingdom of God would be west of a large river. He set up an\r\nearthly kingdom just west of the Mississippi River in Illinois. The town\r\nhad been called Commerce, but Joseph Smith changed the name to Navoo.\r\nJoseph Smith told his followers that Jesus would return at Independence,\r\nMissouri. **While in Independence he was arrested and spent the winter\r\nin the Liberty Jail. At this time he saw a vision of a great river and\r\nJesus was on the west side of the river**. Independence is east of the\r\nMissouri River. Joseph Smith was being transferred to a different jail\r\nand his followers helped him to escape. He traveled on the Mississippi\r\nRiver until he saw a mountain and a town in a valley west of the river.\r\nHe told his followers that this town would now be called Navoo. He said\r\nit was a Greek word meaning \"plateau.\" His followers could not find\r\nNavoo in Greek, but they believed he was a prophet, so they accepted the\r\nnew name….\r\n\r\n**Smith Saw: Jesus Would Return in the Rockies**\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1844 Joseph Smith received a vision called \"The White\r\nHorse Prophecy.\" He saw that Jesus would return in the Rockies. He told\r\nBrigham Young to take the members west and there they would meet up with\r\na group of people who were pure in heart (the salt of the earth).\r\n\r\n<http://www.entrybytroops.org/joseph-smith.html>\r\n\r\nThe overlooked prophesy on The Last Days and the 1891 2nd Coming of\r\nJesus Christ.\r\n\r\nI’ve assembled 47 pages of chronological history taught by the early LDS\r\nChurch, on the Second Advent of Jesus Christ, and predictions of his\r\ncoming in the following years: 1846, before 1880, 1881, 1882 after 1884,\r\n1890-91, 1894.\r\n\r\nThe LDS Church since 1820 has had much to say, about the Last Days and\r\nthe 2nd Coming of Jesus Christ, usually focusing not on preparation for\r\nhis advent, but rather on the signs. This focus often has the effect of\r\nproducing the emotions of fear, doom, and dread – all of them\r\nincompatible with love. Jesus taught “There is no fear in love; but\r\nperfect love casteth out fear” (1 John 4:18)\r\n\r\nIt’s ironic but not surprising that the LDS Church requires more of\r\ntheir members to enter the Kingdom of God then Jesus.<span id=\"28\"\r\nclass=\"anchor\"></span> “v.28 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are\r\nheavy laden, and I will give you rest.  v.29 Take my yoke upon you, and\r\nlearn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest\r\nunto your souls.<span id=\"30\" class=\"anchor\"></span>  v.30 For my yoke\r\nis easy, and my burden is light. [(Matt\r\n11:28-30)](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/11.28-30)\r\n\r\nMr. X\r\n\r\nI have gathered 55 pages of documentation showing the Second Advent of\r\nJesus Christ, and our LDS Prophets and Apostles Predictions of his\r\ncoming in the following years: 1846, before 1880, 1881, 1882 after 1884,\r\n1890-91, 1893. The most prophesied date was 1891.\r\n\r\nNo you aren’t the original chosen people. It was suppose to happen\r\nbefore 1893. Everything on the above list would have been resolved at\r\nChrist second coming; Polygamy, Council of 50, The White Horse Prophecy,\r\nThe Everlasting United Order, The overthrow of the US Government…\r\n\r\nThe Salt Lake Temple was dedicated in 1893, just in time for Jesus\r\nreturn. Have you ever wondered why the Saints could build the Manti,\r\nLogan and St. George Temples in 7 to 13 years but the SLT took 40? I\r\nhave a 1852? newspaper article with Brigham Young stating it would take\r\n10 years to construct at a cost of \\$\\_?\\_ million See April 8, 1893\r\n\r\n1920 was the beginning of the cover up; then the installation of the\r\n1940 “literature censorship committee”\r\n\r\nWhat’s been over looked is that all of Josephs Revelations: Council of\r\nthe 50; Polygamy would come to fruition in 1891 the predicted year of\r\nChrist second advent.\r\n\r\nI like to reveal the Facts, because with Facts you don’t have to rely on\r\nFaith and Feelings.\r\n\r\nClair Barrus\r\n\r\n<http://www.withoutend.org/contributors/clair-barrus/>\r\n\r\n<clairvb@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nIt would please me to share my Second Advent document, with you and you\r\nalone. I’m looking for someone with website design skills to publish my\r\nresearch. I want it to be a living document that others can add to.\r\n~~Would you be willing to publish this?~~ Do you know someone willing to\r\npublish this?\r\n\r\nI’m sending it in its raw format. Please disregard my anger. (I was at a\r\npretty ugly place when I was working on this.)\r\n\r\nI would like to know your story.\r\n\r\nGeorge Daniel Speer Sr. (aka George Reeps)\r\n\r\n<speer.genealogy@gmail.com>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
